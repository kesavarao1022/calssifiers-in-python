## 📥 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-workflow-guide.git
cd ml-workflow-guide
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 🧪 Example Workflow
1. Data Import

  from src.data_import import load_data

  df = load_data("data/sample_dataset.csv")  

2. Preprocessing & Standardization

  from src.preprocessing import preprocess_data

3. Model training
  X_scaled, y = preprocess_data(df)
  Model Training (e.g., Classification)

  from src.classification_models import train_svm_classifier

  model = train_svm_classifier(X_scaled, y)

4. Evaluation

  from src.evaluation import evaluate_model

  evaluate_model(model, X_scaled, y)
